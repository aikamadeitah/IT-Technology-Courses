Virtualization:

Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual resource such as a server, desktop, operating system, file, storage or network.
The most common form of virtualization is the operating system-level virtualization. In operating system-level virtualization, it is possible to run multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware. Virtualization technology involves separating the physical hardware and software by emulating hardware using software. When a different OS is operating on top of the primary OS by means of virtualization, it is referred to as a virtual machine.

A Virtual Machine is a type of sofware that allows us to run a operating system within another operating system.

Reasons to use a virtual machine
-trying a new operating system
-testing an application
-running old applications
